This repository documents the creation and configuration of a Cybersecurity Home Lab designed for practicing and improving skills in network security, penetration testing, and system hardening. The lab simulates a controlled virtual network environment using multiple virtual machines (VMs) to experiment with network attacks, defenses, and traffic analysis.

**Objectives**

The main goals of this project are:

To set up a home lab for cybersecurity learning and practice.

To simulate network attacks and implement defenses.

To analyze network traffic using tools like Wireshark.

To document configurations and create a network diagram for reference.
